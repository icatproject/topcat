        "summary": "The spontaneous formation of multilayer structures at interfaces from surfactant self-assembly is an important structural signature associated with a wide range of technological applications and biological function. This proposal is part of a new programme (EPSRC, EP/G065705) to characterise such structures and to determine the major factor with control their formation and kinetics. We have reported the formation of such surface structures for the anionic surfactant LAS with Ca2+ ions. The kinetics of formation and the ultimate structure formed depends upon when the Ca2+ is added. This is not the case for the single chain systems, SLES. We attribute this to slow association /dissociation kinetics in the Ca2+ induced LAS lamellar structures. We request here beam time on SANS2D to determine the differences in aggregate association / dissociation rates for LAS and SLES by stopped-flow.",

        "summary": "The formation of stable particle dispersions are essential to the success of a wide range of commercial products from inks, paints and foodstuffs to cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. Polymers and surfactants are used routinely to stabilize aqueous dispersions, and these systems have been studied widely. However, significantly less is known about the detailed molecular assembly of polymers adosrbed to the surfaces of drug particles suspended in fluorinated media. Our previous work - through industrial time at the ILL - has shown a complex behaviour. Here we wish to examine the adsoprtion of a series of representative polymer excipients (essentially, poly(ethylene oxide) and their derivatives) to dispersions ofsilica particles in the partially fluorinated solvent, 2H,3H-perfluoropentane (HPFP).",

It is well known that the length of the fatty acid chain in a phopholipid molecule dictates the nature and size of the aggregates a phospholipid forms upon dispersal in water and consequently its interaction with PL. In the present study we have chosen two small phosphocholine lipids, one with a 7-carbon and one with a 6-carbon fatty acid chain, where the latter forms spherical micelles while the former rod-shaped micelles. SANS measurements coupled with stopped flow methodology and using contrast variation will be used to determine the kinetics of the interaction and the rate of destruction of the micellar aggregates.",

We have recently made some progress on understanding their self-assembly in solution and their adsorption behavior at the air-water and liquid-solid interfaces in conjunction with conventional surfactants.

Recent successful high-pressure SANS (HP-SANS) results have shown for the first time that fluorinated surfactants can be used as viscosity modifiers for CO2. Now, very promising quaternary alkylammonium R4N+counter-ion surfactants have also been identified to induce a sphere-to-rod like micelles. This is the first time that R4N+ ions have been incorporated into CO2-philic surfactants including TC14 and AOT4. The combination of custom-made surfactants and the use of mixed-solvents represent new exciting approaches; these proposed HP-SANS experiments are essential to investigate the new R4N+ surfactants as scCO2 viscosity modifiers.",

Their low viscosity is an essential drawback preventing many applications. Better control over their viscosity has consequently a high potential. For the case of droplet microemulsions, an intuitive option is to bridge droplets by amphiphilic polymers. This concept works well for the case of O/W microemulsion droplets and end-capped PEO [Gradzielski 1993]. Interconnecting droplets leads to a substantial increase in viscosity when exceeding an effective percolation concentration of droplets and polymer [Gradzielski 1993, Filali 2001]. The effect of polymers offering multiple arms for highly bridged systems, so far unreported, shall be studied by SANS in detail.",

This has been achieved through the use of a macrocyclic host molecule cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) capable of complexing two guest molecules simultaneously forming a ternary complex with a Ka on the order of 1015 M-1. Upon mixing, the two homopolymers bearing the selective endgroups with CB[8], an AB diblock copolymer is formed which can undergo further self assembly into a variety of compartmentalised structures, such as spherical and cylindrical micelles and vesicles. The formation of a specific structure as well as its overall size can be easily controlled by the ratio of the two homopolymers and we aim to study the architectural details of a range of achievable structures via SANS, using deuterated versions of the hydrophobic block.",

If the bilayer is coated in inorganic material, the pores of the resulting composite can be adjusted simply by water swelling of the initial L3 phase (rather than by increasing surfactant content) and no calcination is required to open up the major pore network. Previous work, using water soluble silica precursors, resulted in aerogel-like materials with poor reproducibility, due to a diffuse silica gel filling the water-regions rather than coating the surfactant bilayer. We are now preparing materials using the L3 phase but with hydrophobic inorganic precursors which are naturally segregated in the bilayer.

As we intend to use these films for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and sensor support the toxicity of thesurfactants used means we have had to develop alternative film forming systems. Therefore we are investigating surfactant-templated polymer films comprised of a less toxic zwitterionic sulfobetaine surfactant, calcium chloride and biopolymers. The films are prepared by spray coating a solution of all components upon a substrate, producing a thin film of solution which undergoes rapid solvent evaporation causing an increase in the concentration of surfactant, salt and polymer. In this experiment we will investigate sulfobetaine surfactant, calcium chloride andpolymer interactions using SANS",

The systems of study are reference oil-water interfaces, provided by w/o microemulsions stabilized by AOT. Different additives will be investigated following an evolution of molecular structures, starting with a true hydrotrope, moving to an alkyl hydrotrope, and ending with a chemically related true surfactant.  Such alkyl hydrotropes have chemical properties part way between the two extremes, comprising both surfactant (alkyl tail) and hydrotrope (head group) features. Although they are interesting colloidal stabilizers in their own right, there is only limited scientific literature to consult. Such hydrotropic additives are of great industrial interest, exhibiting detergency efficiencies in both aqueous and oil phases. ",

We propose a SANS experiment to explore the balance of these two terms using mixtures of fully (non-hydrogen bonding) and partially fluorinated (hydrogen bonding) solvents, and polymers which are -OH or CH3- end-capped to vary their hydrogen bonding capacity.  Changes in polymer solution conformation (radius of gyration) due to changing solute-solvent interactions (intermediate Q range), and the formation of polymer clusters due to solute-solute interactions (enhanced scattering at low Q values) will be studied as a function of temperature and/or solvent composition across the phase diagram, to identify which interactions are most important in determining the phase behaviour.",

        "summary": "Assembly of the peptidoglycan later of bacterial cell walls is a validated target for anti-bacterial agents: the late transpeptidation and transglycosylation steps are inhibited by the penicillin and the vancomycin groups of antibiotics respectively. There is considerable interest in the development of novel inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes, but to date few new lead compounds have been generated against earlier steps in the pathway. We will use Small Angle Neutron scattering to determine the low resolution structure of three proteins, MurM, FemA, and FemX from S pneumoniae and S aureus that catalyse the the transfer of glycine from activated tRNA intermediates to peptidoglycan pre-cursors. These preliminary experiments will also lay the ground work for future experiments to determine tRNA-protein complex structures via contrast variation SANS.",

        "summary": "Nuclear power has played an important role in Britain¿s history and is set to play an equally important role in its future. We have recently established a network involving Cardiff University, National Decommissioning Authority, National Nuclear Laboratory and Magnox North to develop rapid, selective methods for the detection and speciation of transuranic radioisotopes  in dilute solution. The goal of this project is to develop a range of complexing reagents of differing lipo- and fluorophilicities that display selectivity towards the target analytes, which upon cation binding, partitions into a microemulsion. There the emission properties of the metal cations may be modulated/ enhanced by for example the presence of a micelle/droplet bound sensitizer. This initial experiment is designed to characterise the structure of a model microemulsion in the presence of such complexes.",

        "summary": "There is exciting potential for SANS to resolve an important problem in homogeneous catalyst chemistry.  The Pd-chiral catalyst 1+ below has significant pan-industrial potential applications, being almost unique for having high selectivity in chiral syntheses. Certain solution conditions trigger a remarkable (and as yet unexplained) shift in selectivity: the catalyst is still effective, but it now loses the all-important chiral selectivity.  Based on extensive 31P-NMR and trial SANS, this thought to be owing to aggregation/oligmerization to generate (1+)n . The requested beam time will allow this intriguing system to be interrogated in detail, to help explain the unusual properties for design of second generation catalysts which retain chiral activity.

The ABCA stacking in cubic close packing is difficult to distinguish from ABAB stacking of a hexagonal close packed structure.  The relative intensities of different peaks help in resolving this problem. However it is indeed possible that there are stacking faults and these possibilities can only be distinguished by measurements made with sample rotation about defined crystal axes.  Studies of an aligned single crystal prepared by flow and of its melting under flow will be made. ",

        "summary": "We are unravelling the solution structures of the Fab and Fc fragments in the IgA antibody family important in mucosal immunology. Having completed the structures for IgA monomer, dimer and its complex with secretory component, we now wish to apply our powerful constrained modelling approach based on neutron and X-ray scattering to study the abnormal form of IgA dimers that is involved in a common cause of renal failure in order to understand how this disease is caused. We are also investigating the solution structures of complexes formed between the major complement regulator factor H and its target C3b. C3 undergo large conformational changes to form C3b, and different crystal structures reveal different domain arrangements. We wish to identify the C3b solution structure by constrained modelling in order to elucidate the moelcular mechanism of how C3b is regulated by factor H.  ",

        "summary": "The proposal aims to explore the oil-in-water (brine) high internal phase emulsion systems (HIPEs) formed by nonylphenol ethoxylate surfactants using contrast variation SANS (CV-SANS). This follows recent experiments with analogous nonylphenol ethoxylate stabilized HIPEs in dense CO2 (scCO2), which lead to enhanced viscosity of the supercritical fluid. Studies of behaviour and properties of analogous HIPEs in bench-top accessible systems using liquid hydrocarbon oil (dodecane) are critical for optimizing scCO2 emulsions.

By contrast, the class of lanthionine antibiotics remians active against clinical isolated of S. aureus, C. difficile and other Gram-positives, which are tolerant to conventional therapies. Their mode of action relies on a unique target, with which they form transmembrane pores. We propose a study of such antibiotic/target pores to obtain the size and shape of the complex and provide scaffolding for building a molecular model; we will investigate the axial extension of the pore using reflectivity techniques and SANS, as well as its lateral dimension using SANS and off-specilar reflectivity measurements. Protonated complexes will be studied in deuterated lipid bilayers. The deuterated lipid will be contrast-matched.  ",

        "summary": "Peptide-functionalized nanoparticle (NP) aggregates have significant potential as biosensors (for specific enzymes) due to their high sensitivity, modular design and simple colourimetric change in response to stimuli. In order to extend the system to different enzymes a better understanding of the response kinetics is required. We propose to use SANS to probe NP-peptide aggregation and triggered dispersion in real-time. Quantitative information describing the change in size, inter-particle spacing and ordering of NP aggregates will be derived from these data. Information on the rate and degree of enzyme cleavage would be used to quantitatively understand and optimise the factors affecting the efficiency of dispersion. The characteristic colour of NP suspensions is dependent on their separation, size and size distribution, necessitating detailed, accurate information on these properties.",

In the low concentration regime we find a super spin glass behaviour, whereas for x around 39 a superferromagnetic state is settled. We have used a bunch of complementary structural techniques (TEM, XRD, HAADF) which show signs for the existence of nanoparticles. These nanoparticles affect clearly the magnetisation and resistivity response measured between 2-300 K. However, the nanoparticle magnetic behaviour can only be defined and interpreted with SANS. For this purpose we ask for the application of a magnetic field using the capability of SANS2D with a H = 2 T magnet to extract the magnetic signal above and below the irreversibility temperature (below 30 K).

We have created a series of novel additives, which contain multiple (4 or 8) polar functional groups per polymer chain that we anticipate will be highly active at polar interfaces.  To a large extent however, the utility of these additives is limited by their ability to diffuse to the relevant surface or interface, and our previous work on the corresponding fluorocarbon multi end functional polymers has shown that multiple groups can lead to a range of morphologies with widely differing mobility in the melt.  We request SANS beamtime to study these new materials in molten blends.  ",

This instrument is unique in that it will allow the simultaneous characterisation of both the secondary gamma prime (70-400nm) and the tertiary gamma prime (5-50nm) precipitate distributions.  The results that will be obtained will be used to validate computer models of the precipitation behaviour in these alloys along with data acquired using TEM and 3DAPT.  The three alloys have been chosen (RR1000, U720, Waspaloy) as they exhibit a range of precipitation kinetics and morphologies representative of polycrystalline nickel based superalloys. For each alloy data will be acquired continuously for 16 hours at the appropriate precipitate aging temperature.  Given set up time a total of 3 DAYS of beam time is requested on Sans2D.",

Individual proteins may be solved by X-ray crystallography but the relationships between subunits and their adopted conformations are accessible to SANS studies. We are studying a complex that is not only important for the biology of E.coli bacteria but also represents many membrane bound complexes across biology. The protein colicin N uses the receptor OmpF to translocate across the outer membrane and kill the cell. Using combinations of deuterated protein, detergent and water we are able to separate the components of the complex and resolve their interactions. We wish to use SANS 2D to obtain a wide range of Q in order to model the structure in detail.

Understanding the nature of the polymer-surfactant interaction at the oil-water interface is an essential prerequisite to the development of such micro-encapsulation systems, and this is the basis of a new collaborative research programme between Oxford and Unilever. We porpose here SANS measurements to probe the structure of polyelectrolyte-surfactant mixtures at the oil-water interface as an initial phase of this new project.",

The dynamic process and the mixing will be supported by using an online stopped-flow system. As this is the first time this type of experiment is tried, a substantial part of effort will be devoted to experimental setup and optimisation of the working conditions. The work will be essnetial for us to identify the contributing roles of structure and charge of the complexes on cell transfection efficiency",

        "summary": "Recent experiments on SANS2D have indicated that small colloidal particles can act as macroions that screen the charged interactions of larger particles.  This can cause changes in the crystalline order displayed by the large particles and would eventually lead to a region of instability.  Undeerstanding this process is important as it can be crucial as regards stability of polydisperse, electrostatically stabilised dispersions.  The present proposal is to extend previous studies to high concentrations (up to 25%) and a broader range of size ratios.  These experiments will use contrast variation with deuterated and hydrogenous polystyrene latices as model particles.  T",

        "summary": "This proposal aims use a novel approach whereby deuterated amyloid peptide fibrils are givenhydrogenated growing ends, and analysed using SANS. The data will enable us to measureindependently both fibril length and linear growth rates for amyloid fibrils. This cannot be doneusing current biophysical techniques, which only probe the rates of conversion of overall %peptide in non-fibrillar to fibrillar form; our proposed experiments absolutely depend on the ability to exploit the contrast between hydrogenated and deuterated peptides that neutron scattering allows. Linear growth rate information is key to understanding the physico-chemical and biological properties of amyloid fibrils, in processes ranging from prion disease propagation, to self-assembly of artificial peptide nano-fibers, and our method will greatly enhance research in the field.",

Following our earlier solution structures for IgG, IgA and other human antibodies, we will apply our powerful constrained modelling approach based on neutron and X-ray scattering to study conformational changes and stabilities of IgG antibodies that are crucial to bioprocessing and biotechnology applications. We are also investigating the solution structures of complexes formed between the major complement regulator factor H and its target C3b. C3 undergo large conformational changes to form C3b, and different crystal structures reveal different domain arrangements. We wish to identify the C3b solution structure by constrained modelling in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of how C3b is regulated by factor H.  ",

Our aim with this proposal is to find structural explanations for these dynamical behaviours. In the case of glycerol-water and xylitol-water mixtures we would like to understand why two glass transition (Tg) temperatures are obtained in the intermediate or high water concentration range. For small amounts of added non-dissolvable water to 2-ethyl-1-hexanol we aim to investigate the size and shape of the water clusters in order to understand an exceptionally slow dielectric relaxation process. This proposal is central, and therefore of high importance, for the PhD student Khalid Elamin¿s thesis work on alcohol-water mixtures.",

        "summary": "This proposal aims to explore cheap and environmental-benign cosurfactants (or cosolvents) for yielding CO2-philic hydrocarbon surfactant/water/CO2 microemulsions (W/CO2 microemulsions) at high water-to-surfactant molar ratios (W0), under mild pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions.  In close collaboration, University of Bristol and Hirosaki University (Japan) have been developing new, very promising hydrocarbon surfactants for W/CO2 microemulsions (Table 1). The high-pressure SANS (HP-SANS) experiments proposed will permit an exploration of surfactant+co-surfactant synergism in W/CO2 microemulsions, potentially leading to cheap and environmental-benign W/CO2 microemulsions which can form under mild conditions.",

        "summary": "SANS will be used to determine the structure of nanotube dispersions formed by H-bond stacking of cyclopeptides coated with a sheath of stabilizing polymer.  Cyclopeptide stacking favours infinitely long nanotubes, but their length and diameter are modulated by solvent interactions, by monomer type and degree of polymerization, and by temperature.  By varying mixed solvent composition from trifluoroacetic acid, in which no self-assembly occurs, through to (deuterated) dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran, we will measure the size and core-shell nanostructure of these nanotubes, including solvent access to the internal cavity and the structure of and chain conformation the polymeric sheath.  Structures in mixed systems and mixtures with specifically-designed capping agents will be investigated as a mechanism to control length and polydispersity of the nanotubes. ",

        "summary": "Tri-block copolymers offer an excellent model system for the study of crystallization in the bulk as well as close to interfaces. It is known that the structures formed by this systems are highly sensitive to the surface energy of the solid surface. The idea of the present experiment is to draw a complete picture of the crystallization process of Pluronic micelles close to silicon substrates. This will be achieved by exploiting the wavelength dependence in the penetration depth for a time of flight gracing incident small angle scattering study and by separating the specularly scattered intensity from the small angle scattering by use of spin echo techniques in neutron reflectometry.",
