$h1 TopCAT Installation Guide

$h2 Compatibility

TopCAT requires Java 8+, icat.server 4.6+ and ids.server 1.5.0.+

TopCAT 2.4.3 reflects schema changes added in icat.server 4.10. If your configuration requires any of these
schema changes then you should install 2.4.3 or later.

$h2 Prerequisites

  - The TopCAT distribution: [topcat-${project.version}-distro.zip](${repoUrl}/org/icatproject/topcat/${project.version}/topcat-${project.version}-distro.zip)
  - A suitable deployed container (here assumed to be glassfish) to support a web application. Testing has been carried out with Glassfish 4.0. [Glassfish installation instructions](http://icatproject.org/installation/glassfish/) are available.
  -  A database as described in [Database installation instructions](http://icatproject.org/installation/database/) installed on the server.
  - Python (version 2.4 to 2.7) installed on the server.

$h2 Summary of Steps

  1. Please follow the [generic installation instructions](http://icatproject.org/installation/component/) 
  1. Check that it works by going to https\://example.com:8181 or whatever is the name of your server.

$h2 Schema upgrade

If you are using an older version of Topcat you may need to apply some migrations to your database. These can be found in the "migrations/" directory within the Topcat release.

$h3 Upgrade 2.4.1 schema to 2.4.2

The CACHE table now requires an extra column, CREATION_TIME. The simplest upgrade is to drop the
existing table; this is done by the provided migration scripts.

$h3 Upgrade 2.3.x schema to 2.4.0

For MySQL:

```
  ALTER TABLE `DOWNLOAD` 
    DROP COLUMN `TRANSPORT_URL`,
    DROP COLUMN `ICAT_URL`;
```

For Oracle:

```
  ALTER TABLE DOWNLOAD DROP (TRANSPORT_URL,ICAT_URL);
```

This migration should be performed before deploying Topcat.


$h3 Upgrade 2.1.0 schema to 2.2.0

For MySQL:

```
  ALTER TABLE `DOWNLOAD` ADD `THE_SIZE` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL;
```

For Oracle:

```
  ALTER TABLE DOWNLOAD ADD THE_SIZE NUMBER(19, 0) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
```

$h2 Configuration Overview

Topcat is configured in two main places:

  * **the backend** - i.e. files which topcat server reads/uses
  * **the frontend** - i.e. files which the browser reads/uses

$h3 Backend configuration


The backend configuration consists of two files:

  * **topcat-setup.properties** - used to configure the application container e.g. database connection and mail server etc...
  * **topcat.properties** - used to configure Topcat (application) specific settings e.g. email messages or IDS polling intervals.

$h3 Frontend configuration

The frontend configuration consists of three files:

  * **topcat.json** - used to configure the structure and behaviour of the frontend e.g. grid columns and ICAT data hierarchy.
  * **lang.json** - used to changed the words on topcat; either the actual language e.g. from English to French, or to substitute words that make more sense to your facility e.g. "Investigator" to "Scientist"
  * **topcat.css** - allows you to change Topcat's styling the page colours etc...

$h2 topcat-setup.properties

Note: '#'s are comments.

```

The mail.xxx properties can be omitted if email support is not required in Topcat.
In this case, mail.enable in topcat.properties MUST NOT be set to true. This is NOT checked during setup.

$h2 topcat.properties

$h3 New in 2.4.4

The `ids.timeout` property can now have an optional `s` or `m` suffix to specify seconds or minutes.
The default remains milliseconds (so existing configurations do not need to be changed).

$h3 New properties in 2.4.2

New properties have been added to allow finer control over caching of Investigation sizes.
Investigations can change size over time, so setting a lifetime on cached values may be useful.
It may be useful not to cache zero-sized Investigations at all.
Note that size requests are also cached in the browser, so check settings in topcat.json too.
However, the browser cache is less persistent, and can be cleared by reloading the page, so
browser cache consistency is less of an issue.

These properties are optional, and the defaults preserve the original behaviour, so they need 
not be added when upgrading.

```
  # Lifetime in seconds for cached Investigation sizes (default is 0, which means "immortal")
  investigationSizeCacheLifetimeSeconds=600

  # Whether to cache zero-sized Investigations (default is false)
  neverCacheZeroSizedInvestigations=true
```

$h3 Upgrade from 2.3.6 to 2.4.0

If you are upgrading from 2.3.6 or earlier to 2.4.0, the following properties should be added to your topcat.properties:
`facility.list`, `facility.[facilityName].icatUrl`, `facility.[facilityName].idsUrl` (for each `facilityName` in `facility.list`).

Where a facility offers multiple download transfer types (as specified in topcat.json), a specific URL (prefix) for a particular facility
and download type can be specified by defining `facility.[facilityName].downloadType.[transport]` - see below for examples.
If the property is not defined for a particular facility and download type, the facility's idsUrl will be used instead.

Note: '#'s are comments.

```
  # List of Facility names
  # These names will be used by Topcat over the REST API;
  # each facility name in topcat.json must contain a match in this list,
  # and each name must be mapped to ICAT / IDS urls.
  # Edit these values to match your installation.

  facility.list = LILS YFH

  facility.LILS.icatUrl = http://localhost:8080
  facility.LILS.idsUrl = http://localhost:8080
  facility.YFH.icatUrl = https://your.facility.icatUrl.here
  facility.YFH.idsUrl = https://your.facility.idsUrl.here

  # Download transport URLs
  # topcat.json can specify one or more download transport types for each facility, egs "https", "globus";
  # each may have a distinct download URL (prefix). To specify the download URL for a specific facility
  # and transport type, set an appropriate property as below.
  # Note that the transport type will be set in requests from the Topcat Javascript application,
  # but the URL to specify here should be the IDS url that will be used in the Java clients;
  # so it may be that the Javascript transport type https should be mapped here to an
  # internal http URL.
  # If the property is not defined, Topcat will use the facility's idsUrl by default.

  facility.LILS.downloadType.http = http://localhost:8080
  facility.YFH.downloadType.https = https://your.facility.downloadIdsUrl.here
  facility.YFH.downloadType.globus = https://your.facility.globusUrl.here

$h2 topcat.json

$h3 High level overview

A high level overview of the topcat.json file is as follows:

```
  {
    "site": {...},
    "facilities": {...}
  }
```

from the above example there are two attributes defined: 

  * "site" - configures anything anything global across facilities e.g. the cart, information pages or branding etc.
  * "facilities" - configures anything specific to a facility e.g. authentication, column headings or download transport (i.e. delivery) methods.

$h3 Medium level overview

If we expand the attributes in high level overview we can get a medium overview as follows:

```

      "site": {
          "topcatUrl": "https://example.com",
          "home" : "my-data",

  }
```
  * "enableSelection" - whether or not the entity can be added to the cart. This only applies to "investigation", "dataset" or "datafile".
  * "enableUpload" - whether or not a user can upload files at this at this level (i.e. enable an "Upload" button). This only applies to "dataset" or "datafile".
  * "columnDefs" - the column definitions of the grid.
          * "field" - The field you want to display in the column.
              * the dot notation e.g. "investigationInstrument.fullName" refers to "[variable name].[field name]" - see the "standard jpql variables" for more info.
              * there are also 3 special field names which get loaded in asynchronously.
                  * size - the sum of all the descendant files fileSize (applies to the investigation and dataset entities).
                  * datasetCount - the total number of descendant datasets (applies to the investigation entity).
                  * datafileCount - the total number of descendant datafiles (applies to the investigation and dataset entities).
          * "link" - whether or not to link to the next entity in the hierachy.
          * "breadcrumb" - whether or not you want to use the field value as title in the breadcrumb. By default this will be 'title' or 'name' if the entity has these fields.
          * "excludeFuture" - will preload the date 'to' filter with the current time, thus elliminating any rows in the future.
          * "sort" - allows the sorting of the rows by this particular column.
              * "direction" - the direction the rows should be sorted by can be "asc" (ascending) or "desc" (descending).
              * "priority" - if sorting by multiple columns, you can set the order in which rows get sorted by e.g. "title" then "startDate".

To get a better understanding of what these jpql variables refer to please view the [icat schema documentation](https://repo.icatproject.org/site/icat/server/4.9.3/schema.html).

$h2 The "content" directory

After unzipping a Topcat release you will be presented with a directory called "content.example", which you need to make a copy of called "content" i.e.

```bash
  cp -R content.example content
```

This newly created directory allows you to either replace or add files within the war file (which is actually the same format as a zip file), to view the existing contents of this war (i.e. zip) file by running the following:

```bash
  unzip -l topcat-2.4.0.war
```

after running:

```bash
  ./setup install
```

the contents of the "content" directory will be injected into the war file just before deploying.

You can use this feature to create a "pages" directory, which is where the html content specified within topcat.json's "pages" section is defined, you can also this feature to replace or add any other content e.g. the favicon.

$h2 lang.json

Allows you to replace text/phrases within Topcat's interface with your own prefered alternatives e.g. rather than term "Investigation" you might prefer "Visit".

Within lang.json is a json object that represents a hierarchy of translation strings, with a bit of experimentation you can modify virtually any text in Topcat's front end e.g. if you wanted to change the "My Data" tab text simply edit "MAIN_NAVIGATION" -> "MAIN_TAB" -> "MY_DATA".

$h2 topcat.css

As standard css file adding in custom css rules.

$h2 Browser console monitoring

(Added in 2.4.2)

In the browser console, typing:

```
  tc.setMonitoring(true)
```

will start monitoring behaviour of the (browser-side) cache and the low-priority queue. At regular intervals,
Topcat will report to the console recent and all-time counts of cache hits/misses, the maximum length of the
low-priority queue (which is used to process getSize requests), and the maximum wait time (in milliseconds) of
entries in the queue. Here, "recent" means "in the last 10 minutes".

This information may be useful when experimenting with cache control configuration for investigation sizes.

To turn off monitoring again, type `tc.setMonitoring(false)` into the console.


$h2 topcat_admin

The topcat_admin script was added to Topcat in October 2017, but was not included in the distribution until version 2.4.4.
It uses the new REST API for disabling/enabling download types (which cannot be done from the browser Admin interface at present.)
The setup script will copy this script to the user's bin directory if it exists. (It does not insist that it exists, for
backwards compatibility with installation processes that work with previous versions.)

topcat_admin requires the Python requests module to be installed; setup neither checks nor ensures that this is the case.
The script can be run from any suitable system; it need not be run on the Topcat server.
